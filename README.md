## Model Hyperparameters and Data Augmentation

#### Core Hyperparameters
```python
IMAGE_SIZE = 224        # Size of input images (224x224 pixels)
BATCH_SIZE = 32        # Number of images processed in each training step
VALIDATION_SPLIT = 0.2  # 20% of data used for validation
MAX_EPOCHS = 20        # Maximum number of training cycles
EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE = 7  # Stop training if no improvement for 7 epochs
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001  # How fast the model learns
```

#### Data Augmentation Parameters
```python
ROTATION_RANGE = 20     # Random rotation by up to 20 degrees
SHIFT_RANGE = 0.2      # Random shift by up to 20% of image size
SHEAR_RANGE = 0.2      # Random shear by up to 20%
ZOOM_RANGE = 0.2       # Random zoom by up to 20%
```

#### Data Processing Pipeline
The code sets up three data generators:
1. **Training Generator**: 
   - Applies all augmentations (rotation, shift, shear, zoom)
   - Rescales pixel values to 0-1 range (1/255)
   - Uses 80% of training data

2. **Validation Generator**:
   - Uses same augmentation settings
   - Uses 20% of training data
   - Helps monitor model performance during training

3. **Test Generator**:
   - Only rescales images (no augmentation)
   - Used for final model evaluation

#### Why Data Augmentation?
Data augmentation creates variations of training images by:
- Rotating them slightly
- Shifting them around
- Changing their size
- Flipping them horizontally

This helps the model:
- Learn to recognize objects in different positions
- Prevent overfitting
- Improve generalization to new images

## Image Visualization

### Data Visualization Function

```python
def plot_sample_images(generator, title):
    """Plot a grid of sample images from the generator"""
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
    for i in range(5):
        plt.subplot(3, 5, i+1)
        batch = next(generator)
        image = batch[0][0]
        plt.imshow(image)
        plt.title(f'Class: {list(generator.class_indices.keys())[batch[1][0].argmax()]}')
        plt.axis('off')
    plt.suptitle(title, size=16)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

#### How This Function Works:
1. **Setup**: Creates a figure window of size 15x8 inches
2. **Image Loading**:
   - `next(generator)`: Gets the next batch of images from our data generator
   - `batch[0][0]`: Gets the first image from the batch
   - `batch[1][0]`: Gets the corresponding label

3. **Display Details**:
   - Shows 5 images in a row
   - Each image is labeled with its class name
   - `plt.axis('off')`: Removes axis lines for cleaner visualization

4. **Purpose**: 
   - Helps visualize what the model "sees" during training
   - Useful for verifying data loading and augmentation
   - Confirms correct class labeling

When called with `plot_sample_images(train_generator, 'Original Training Images')`, it shows original images from the training set.

## Data Augmentation Visualization

This code demonstrates how data augmentation works on a single image:

```python
# Create augmentation generator
aug_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=40,      # Rotate image up to 40 degrees
    width_shift_range=0.2,  # Shift image horizontally up to 20%
    height_shift_range=0.2, # Shift image vertically up to 20%
    shear_range=0.2,       # Shear image up to 20%
    zoom_range=0.2,        # Zoom in/out up to 20%
    horizontal_flip=True,   # Randomly flip image horizontally
    fill_mode='nearest'     # Fill empty spaces with nearest pixels
)

# Get and prepare a sample image
sample_image, _ = next(train_generator)
sample_image = sample_image[0]  # Take first image from batch

# Create generator for this single image
aug_generator = aug_datagen.flow(
    np.expand_dims(sample_image, axis=0),  # Add batch dimension
    batch_size=1
)

# Display 5 different augmented versions
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize=(20, 20))
for i in range(5):
    augmented_image = next(aug_generator)[0]
    axes[i].imshow(augmented_image)
    axes[i].axis('off')
plt.show()
```

#### What This Code Does:
1. **Creates Augmentation Settings**:
   - More aggressive rotation (40° vs 20° in training)
   - Same shift, shear, and zoom settings (20%)
   - Enables horizontal flipping
   
2. **Sample Image Processing**:
   - Takes one image from training data
   - Prepares it for augmentation by adding a batch dimension

3. **Visualization**:
   - Shows 5 different random augmentations of the same image
   - Helps understand how data augmentation varies your training data

This visualization is crucial for:
- Understanding how augmentation affects your images
- Verifying augmentation settings are appropriate
- Ensuring augmentations maintain important image features

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture

Here's our simple but effective CNN model for image classification:

```python
def create_simple_cnn():
    model = models.Sequential([
        # First Convolutional Block
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, 3), name='conv1'),
        layers.BatchNormalization(name='bn1'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='pool1'),

        # Second Convolutional Block
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv2'),
        layers.BatchNormalization(name='bn2'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='pool2'),

        # Third Convolutional Block
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv3'),
        layers.BatchNormalization(name='bn3'),

        # Dense Layers
        layers.Flatten(name='flatten'),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense1'),
        layers.Dropout(0.5, name='dropout1'),
        layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax', name='output')
    ])
    return model
```

### Architecture Breakdown

#### 1. Convolutional Blocks
The model has three convolutional blocks that process the image features:

**First Block**:
- `Conv2D(32, (3, 3))`: 
  - 32 filters of size 3x3
  - Learns basic features like edges and colors
  - Input shape: (224, 224, 3) - RGB images
- `BatchNormalization`: Stabilizes training
- `MaxPooling2D(2, 2)`: Reduces image size by half

**Second Block**:
- `Conv2D(64, (3, 3))`: 
  - Doubles filters to 64
  - Learns more complex patterns
- `BatchNormalization`: Continues stabilizing training
- `MaxPooling2D`: Further reduces image size

**Third Block**:
- `Conv2D(64, (3, 3))`: 
  - Maintains 64 filters
  - Learns highest-level features
- `BatchNormalization`: Final normalization

#### 2. Classification Head
After feature extraction, the model classifies the image:

- `Flatten`: Converts 2D feature maps to 1D vector
- `Dense(64)`: Combines features for classification
- `Dropout(0.5)`: Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping 50% of connections
- `Dense(2, 'softmax')`: Final layer for 2-class classification

### How Information Flows
1. Image (224x224x3) → First Block → (112x112x32)
2. Second Block → (56x56x64)
3. Third Block → Feature maps
4. Flatten → Dense → Predictions

### Key Features
- **ReLU Activation**: Helps learn non-linear patterns
- **Batch Normalization**: Makes training faster and more stable
- **MaxPooling**: Reduces computation while keeping important features
- **Dropout**: Prevents the model from memorizing training data

### Why This Architecture Works
- Gradually increases complexity (32 → 64 filters)
- Balances model size and performance
- Uses proven techniques (BatchNorm, Dropout) for stable training
- Simple enough to train quickly, complex enough to learn meaningful features

### Deep Dive: Core CNN Operations

Let's understand how each operation in our CNN works and affects training:

#### 1. Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)
```python
Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
```

**What it Does:**
- Works like a scanning flashlight over the image
- Each filter (32 total) is a 3x3 grid that looks for specific patterns
- Slides across the image, creating a "feature map"

**Example Features Learned:**
- First few filters learn:
  - Vertical and horizontal edges
  - Color transitions
  - Simple textures
- Later filters combine these to detect:
  - Corners
  - Circular patterns
  - Complex textures

**Training Impact:**
- More filters (32) = More patterns detected
- Larger filter size (3x3) = Looks at bigger image areas
- Too many filters = Slower training, possible overfitting
- Too few filters = Might miss important patterns

#### 2. Batch Normalization
```python
BatchNormalization()
```

**What it Does:**
- Normalizes the output of Conv2D layer
- Keeps values in a reasonable range (around 0)
- Adds small learnable parameters (β and γ)

**Why it's Important:**
1. **Training Speed:**
   - Prevents extreme values that slow learning
   - Allows higher learning rates
   
2. **Stability:**
   - Reduces "internal covariate shift"
   - Makes training more predictable

3. **Regularization:**
   - Adds slight noise during training
   - Helps prevent overfitting

#### 3. MaxPooling
```python
MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
```

**What it Does:**
- Takes 2x2 patches of the image
- Keeps the highest value in each patch
- Reduces image size by half in both dimensions

**Example:**
```
Original 2x2 patch:    After MaxPooling:
[1.2  0.5]            [1.2]
[0.8  0.3]
```

**Benefits for Training:**
1. **Efficiency:**
   - Reduces computation by 75%
   - Less memory usage
   
2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Keeps strongest features
   - Makes model more robust to position changes

3. **Preventing Overfitting:**
   - Reduces spatial dimensions
   - Forces model to focus on most important features

#### How They Work Together

1. **Processing Flow:**
```
Input Image (224x224x3)
↓
Conv2D (Detects features)
↓
BatchNorm (Stabilizes values)
↓
ReLU (Adds non-linearity)
↓
MaxPool (Reduces size)
→ Output: 112x112x32
```

2. **Training Benefits:**
- **Conv2D**: Learns what to look for
- **BatchNorm**: Makes learning stable
- **MaxPool**: Makes it efficient

3. **Memory Impact:**
- Starting: 224 × 224 × 3 = 150,528 values
- After first block: 112 × 112 × 32 = 401,408 values
- Shows why we need MaxPooling to manage memory

This combination of operations has proven extremely effective for image processing tasks, balancing computational efficiency with learning capability.

### Understanding CNN Filters

#### What is a Filter?
A filter (or kernel) is like a small window that scans over an image, looking for specific patterns. Think of it as a tiny pattern detector.

#### Simple Example of a Filter
```
Original Image Patch:    Edge Detection Filter:    Result:
[100  100  100]         [-1   0   1]              Strong edge
[100  100  200]         [-1   0   1]              detected here
[100  100  200]         [-1   0   1]
```

#### Types of Filters

1. **Edge Detection Filters:**
```
Vertical Edge Filter:   Horizontal Edge Filter:
[-1  0  1]             [-1  -1  -1]
[-1  0  1]             [ 0   0   0]
[-1  0  1]             [ 1   1   1]
```

2. **Basic Feature Filters:**
```
Corner Detection:       Blob Detection:
[ 1  -1  0]            [ 1   1   1]
[-1   2  -1]           [ 1  -8   1]
[ 0  -1   1]           [ 1   1   1]
```

#### How Filters Work in Our CNN

1. **First Layer (32 filters of 3x3):**
   ```
   Input: RGB Image (224x224x3)
   Each filter: 3x3x3 matrix
   Output: 32 feature maps
   ```

2. **Filter Operation:**
   - Slides across image (like a moving window)
   - At each position:
     * Multiplies values
     * Sums results
     * Applies activation (ReLU)

#### Real-world Analogy
Imagine looking at a large painting through 32 different magnifying glasses:
- One glass highlights edges
- Another shows textures
- Another detects circles
- And so on...

#### What Our 32 Filters Learn:
1. **Low-Level Features** (First few filters):
   - Straight lines
   - Simple edges
   - Basic color transitions

2. **Mid-Level Features** (Middle filters):
   - Corners
   - Simple shapes
   - Textures

3. **High-Level Features** (Later filters):
   - Complex patterns
   - Specific object parts
   - Distinctive textures

#### Filter Learning Process
1. **Initial State:**
   - Filters start with random values

2. **During Training:**
   - Filters adjust their values
   - Learn to detect important patterns
   - Become specialized pattern detectors

3. **After Training:**
   - Each filter becomes expert at finding specific features
   - Together, they create a comprehensive feature detection system

#### Impact on Training
- More filters = More patterns detected but slower training
- Larger filters = Larger patterns but more computation
- Filter values are learned through backpropagation

This is why we start with 32 filters (enough to detect basic features) and increase to 64 in later layers (for more complex patterns).

Here's a simple explanation of ReLU and Softmax activation functions:

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
```
- If input > 0: output = input
- If input ≤ 0: output = 0
```
Think of ReLU like a light switch:
- If positive, let it pass through
- If negative, turn it off (make it zero)

**Softmax**
- Takes a group of numbers and turns them into probabilities
- All outputs add up to 1.0
- Commonly used in the final layer for classification tasks

Example:
```python
Input: [2, 1, 0.1]
Softmax output: [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]
```

**Common Uses:**
- ReLU: Hidden layers
- Softmax: Output layer (classification)
Let me break down this code which implements an Inception-style CNN:

**Inception Module Function:**
```python
# This function creates one Inception block with 4 parallel paths
def inception_module(x, filters, stage):
```

**The 4 parallel paths are:**
1. **Path 1**: Simple 1x1 convolution
```python
path1 = Conv2D(filters[0], (1,1))
```

2. **Path 2**: 1x1 conv followed by 3x3 conv
```python
path2 = Conv2D(filters[1], (1,1))
path2 = Conv2D(filters[2], (3,3))
```

3. **Path 3**: 1x1 conv followed by 5x5 conv
```python
path3 = Conv2D(filters[3], (1,1))
path3 = Conv2D(filters[4], (5,5))
```

4. **Path 4**: MaxPool followed by 1x1 conv
```python
path4 = MaxPooling2D()
path4 = Conv2D(filters[5], (1,1))
```

**Main Network Function:**
```python
def create_inception_cnn():
```
This creates the full network with:
- Initial convolution layer
- Two inception modules
- Global average pooling
- Dropout for regularization
- Final dense layer with softmax

The network is designed for binary classification (2 output classes) and expects images of size `IMAGE_SIZE x IMAGE_SIZE` with 3 color channels.

Let me explain the different convolutions and the concatenation:

**Convolution Sizes:**

1. **1x1 Convolution**
```
- Looks at 1 pixel at a time
- Main purpose: Reduce/change channels
- Like a pointwise operation
[■] <- single pixel
```

2. **3x3 Convolution**
```
- Looks at 3x3 pixel area
- Captures local patterns
- Most common size
[■■■]
[■■■] <- 9 pixels
[■■■]
```

3. **5x5 Convolution**
```
- Looks at 5x5 pixel area
- Captures larger patterns
- Wider field of view
[■■■■■]
[■■■■■]
[■■■■■] <- 25 pixels
[■■■■■]
[■■■■■]
```

**MaxPooling**
```
- Reduces spatial dimensions
- Takes maximum value in window
- No learnable parameters
[■■] -> [■]
[■■]
```

**Concatenation**
```python
Concatenate([path1, path2, path3, path4])
```
- Combines outputs from all paths
- Stacks features along channel dimension
- Example:
```
path1: [28x28x64]
path2: [28x28x128]
path3: [28x28x32]
path4: [28x28x32]
Result: [28x28x256] (64+128+32+32)
```

Let me explain GlobalAveragePooling2D in a simple way:

**What it does:**
```python
# Example Input: 7x7 feature map with 64 channels
Input shape: [7, 7, 64]

# Takes average of each 7x7 feature map
Output shape: [1, 1, 64]
```

**Visual Example:**
```
Before:                After:
[2 3 4]
[1 5 6]  →  Average = 3.5
[2 4 4]

For each channel:
[7x7] → [1] (single number)
```

**Benefits:**
1. Reduces parameters dramatically
2. Prevents overfitting
3. Forces the network to identify global features
4. Replaces multiple dense layers

**Real-World Analogy:**
Like taking the average temperature of a city instead of having temperature readings from multiple locations in the city.

This layer is often used before the final classification layer to reduce the spatial dimensions while keeping the essential information.

Let me explain how the Inception module helps in training:

**Main Benefits:**

1. **Multi-Scale Processing**
```
- 1x1 conv: looks at individual pixels
- 3x3 conv: looks at small patterns
- 5x5 conv: looks at larger patterns
```

2. **Efficiency**
```
1x1 convolutions help reduce computations by:
Input: 256 channels
1x1 conv → reduces to 64 channels
3x3 conv → processes fewer channels
```

3. **Parallel Processing**
```
Input Image
    ↓
[Path1] [Path2] [Path3] [Path4]
    ↓      ↓      ↓       ↓ 
    All process simultaneously
```

**Real-World Analogy:**
Like having multiple experts:
- Expert 1: Looks at details
- Expert 2: Looks at small patterns
- Expert 3: Looks at bigger patterns
- Expert 4: Summarizes information

Then combines all their insights for better decision-making.

This design helps the model learn different types of features simultaneously, making it more effective at recognition tasks.

Let me break down how the model is built step by step:

**1. Input Layer**
```python
inputs = layers.Input(shape=(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, 3))
# Takes image input (like 224x224 with 3 colors)
```

**2. Initial Processing**
```python
# First convolution
x = Conv2D(64, (7,7))(inputs)      # Detect basic features
x = BatchNormalization()(x)         # Normalize values
x = MaxPooling2D()(x)              # Reduce size
```

**3. Inception Modules**
```python
# First Inception block
x = inception_module(x, [64, 96, 128, 16, 32, 32], stage=1)
# Has 4 parallel paths:
# - Simple 1x1
# - 1x1 → 3x3
# - 1x1 → 5x5
# - MaxPool → 1x1

# Second Inception block
x = inception_module(x, [128, 128, 192, 32, 96, 64], stage=2)
# Same structure, different filter numbers
```

**4. Final Layers**
```python
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)    # Average each feature map
x = Dropout(0.4)(x)                # Prevent overfitting
outputs = Dense(2, 'softmax')(x)    # Final classification
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Image → Basic Features → Inception1 → Inception2 → Average → Classification
```

Think of it like:
1. Look at basic shapes
2. Look at multiple features at different scales
3. Combine all information
4. Make final decision

Let me explain the MobileNetV2 model creation:

**1. Load Pre-trained Model**
```python
base_model = MobileNetV2(
    weights='imagenet',        # Pre-trained weights
    include_top=False,         # Remove classification layers
    input_shape=(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, 3)  # Input size
)
base_model.trainable = False   # Freeze weights
```

**2. Add New Layers**
```python
model = Sequential([
    # Layer 1: Pre-trained MobileNetV2
    base_model,
    
    # Layer 2: Global Average Pooling
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    
    # Layer 3: Dense layer with 64 neurons
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    
    # Layer 4: Dropout for preventing overfitting
    Dropout(0.2),
    
    # Layer 5: Final classification layer
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Image → MobileNetV2 → Average → Dense(64) → Dropout → Output(2)
```

**Key Points:**
- Uses pre-trained model (transfer learning)
- Freezes original weights
- Adds custom layers for new task
- Final layer has 2 outputs (binary classification)

This is like using an expert's knowledge (pre-trained model) and adding your own specific decision-making layers on top.

Let me break down the training process:

**1. Setup Training**
```python
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=LEARNING_RATE)
model.compile(
    optimizer=optimizer,
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',  # For classification
    metrics=['accuracy']              # Track accuracy
)
```

**2. Callbacks Setup**
```python
# Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting
callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',      # Watch validation loss
    patience=5               # Wait 5 epochs before stopping
)

# Model Checkpoint: Saves best model
callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    save_best_only=True,     # Only save when improved
    monitor='val_accuracy'   # Watch validation accuracy
)

# Reduce Learning Rate: Helps fine-tune
callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    factor=0.2,              # Reduce LR by 20%
    patience=2               # Wait 2 epochs before reducing
)
```

**3. Training**
```python
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,          # Training data
    epochs=MAX_EPOCHS,        # Number of iterations
    validation_data=val_generator,  # Validation data
    callbacks=callbacks       # Use callbacks
)
```

**Process Flow:**
```
For each epoch:
1. Train on training data
2. Check validation performance
3. Maybe save model (if best)
4. Maybe stop early (if not improving)
5. Maybe reduce learning rate
```

Think of it like teaching with constant monitoring and adjustments based on performance.

Let me explain why we choose ReLU and Softmax:

**ReLU in Hidden Layers:**
```python
# Advantages of ReLU:
1. Simple and Fast
   input > 0: output = input
   input ≤ 0: output = 0

2. Helps with Vanishing Gradient
   - Doesn't saturate for positive values
   - Gradient stays strong

3. Sparse Activation
   - Some neurons become inactive
   - Network becomes lighter
```

**Softmax in Output Layer:**
```python
# Perfect for Classification because:
1. Converts numbers to probabilities
   [2.0, 1.0, 0.5] → [0.6, 0.3, 0.1]

2. All outputs add up to 1.0
   Good for multi-class problems

3. Shows confidence levels
   Higher number = more confident
```

**Why Not Others?**
```python
Sigmoid: 
- Can cause vanishing gradients
- Output range [0,1]

Tanh:
- Similar issues to sigmoid
- Output range [-1,1]

Linear:
- Too simple
- Can't learn complex patterns
```

This combination (ReLU + Softmax) has become standard because it works well for most deep learning tasks.

Let me break down this evaluation code into main parts:

**1. Training History Plots**
```python
# Creates two plots side by side
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  # Accuracy Plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  # Loss Plot

# Shows:
- Training accuracy/loss (blue line)
- Validation accuracy/loss (orange line)
- How model improves over epochs
```

**2. Test Set Evaluation**
```python
# Get overall performance
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_generator)
# Shows final accuracy and loss on test data
```

**3. Confusion Matrix**
```python
# Creates heatmap showing:
- True Positives (correct predictions)
- False Positives (wrong predictions)
- False Negatives (missed predictions)

Example for binary classification:
[90  10]  # 90 correct class 0, 10 wrong
[5   95]  # 5 wrong, 95 correct class 1
```

**4. Classification Report**
```python
# Shows detailed metrics:
- Precision (accuracy of positive predictions)
- Recall (ability to find all positives)
- F1-score (balance of precision and recall)
```

**5. Sample Predictions**
```python
# Shows 10 example images with:
- Original image
- True label
- Predicted label
- Green: correct prediction
- Red: wrong prediction
```

This evaluation helps understand:
- How well the model learned
- Where it makes mistakes
- Overall performance metrics
- Visual confirmation of predictions

Let me explain the Confusion Matrix in a simple way:

**Basic Structure (Binary Classification)**
```
                 Predicted
Actual    [Negative  Positive]
Negative  [   TN       FP   ]
Positive  [   FN       TP   ]

TN = True Negative
FP = False Positive
FN = False Negative
TP = True Positive
```

**Real Example (Cat vs Dog)**
```
Predicted →    Dog    Cat
Actual Dog  [  90     10  ]
Actual Cat  [  5      95  ]

Means:
- 90 dogs correctly identified as dogs (TN)
- 10 dogs wrongly identified as cats (FP)
- 5 cats wrongly identified as dogs (FN)
- 95 cats correctly identified as cats (TP)
```

**What It Tells Us:**
1. **Accuracy** = (TP + TN) / Total
```python
(90 + 95) / 200 = 92.5%
```

2. **Common Mistakes**
```python
- Where model confuses classes
- Which class is harder to predict
```

3. **Model Bias**
```python
- If model favors one class
- If predictions are balanced
```

This helps us:
- Find model weaknesses
- Understand error types
- Improve model performance
- Make better decisions about model usage

Let me explain F1-Score in a very simple way:

**F1-Score Simplified:**
```python
# It's a balance between:
1. How precise we are (Precision)
2. How many we catch (Recall)
```

**Real-World Example:**
```
Fishing Analogy:
Precision: How many fish (vs trash) you catch
Recall: How many fish you catch out of all fish in pond

Good F1 = Good at both catching lots of fish AND not catching trash
```

**Scores Example:**
```
Bad F1 (0.2):
- Catches very few fish
- OR catches lots of trash

Medium F1 (0.5):
- Good at one thing but bad at other
- Catches many fish but also lots of trash
- OR catches very few fish but all are correct

Good F1 (0.9):
- Catches most fish
- Almost no trash caught
```

**Simple Rule:**
- F1 is high only when both Precision and Recall are good
- F1 is low if either Precision or Recall is bad
- Perfect F1 = 1.0
- Worst F1 = 0.0
