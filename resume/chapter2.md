From the provided content, I can see this PDF focuses on Loss Functions in Deep Learning. Let me break down the main sections:

**Main Sections:**
1. Loss Functions for Regression
2. Loss Functions for Classification
3. Binary Classification Example

Let's go through each section in detail:

### 1. Loss Functions for Regression
Two main types of loss functions are discussed for regression problems:

1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
```
MSE = (1/N) Σ(yi - ŷi)²
```
- This measures the average squared difference between predicted (ŷi) and actual (yi) values
- More sensitive to outliers due to squaring

2. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
```
MAE = (1/N) Σ|yi - ŷi|
```
- Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
- More robust to outliers than MSE

For a linear regression model (f(x) = ax + b), the loss function is:
```
J(a,b) = (1/2n) Σ(ax⁽ⁱ⁾ + b - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
```

### 2. Loss Functions for Classification

Two main types:

1. **Binary Cross Entropy/Log Loss**
```
Log loss = -(1/N) Σ[yi log(ŷi) + (1-yi)log(1-ŷi)]
```
- Used for binary classification problems
- Measures the performance of a model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1

2. **Categorical Cross Entropy**
```
Loss = -(1/N) Σ Σ yij log(ŷij)
```
- Used for multi-class classification problems
- K represents the number of classes

### 3. Binary Classification Example
The example demonstrates:
- Model: y = wx + b
- Activation function: Sigmoid = 1/(1+e⁻ʸ)
- Practical calculation with:
  - Inputs: X1 = 2.6, X2 = 3.1
  - Weights: w1 = 0.29, w2 = 0.24
  - Bias b = 0

The gradient descent process is shown with:
- Chain rule application
- Weight updates
- Bias updates
- Learning rate (α) = 0.2

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or concept?
